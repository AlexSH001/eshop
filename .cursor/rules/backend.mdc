# Project Background
This is a multi-language online shop web application built with Next.js 15 App Router using TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS

# Coding Standards
- Use functional components and Hooks, avoid class components
- Prefer `const` over `let` for variable declarations
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for component names

# Preferred Libraries
- Use Next.js for navigation
- Use next-intl for internationalization
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

# File Structure
- components: Reusable UI components
- app/[locale]: Next.js pages supporting multiple languages
- data/blog: Multi-language blog files
- app/api: API service functions

# Data

# Performance Optimization Guidelines
- Use React.memo for pure function components
- Implement lazy loading for route components
- Optimize useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders

# Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Ensure at least 80% test coverage
- Use snapshot testing for UI components

# Documentation Standards
- Write comments for functions and components using JSDoc format
- Include PropTypes validation in components
- Each major directory must contain a README.md file in both English and Chinese

# Error Handling Preferences
- Use try/catch blocks for asynchronous operations
- Implement a global error boundary component
